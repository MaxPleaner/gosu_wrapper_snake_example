This is a demo snake game using my 
[gosu_wrapper](http://github.com/maxpleaner/gosu_wrapper).

Everything custom here is in [`app.rb`](./app.rb), [`app/helpers.rb`](./app/helpers.rb),
[`app/hooks.rb`](./app/hooks.rb), or [`app/state.rb`](app/state.rb).

The snake game isn't wonderful, fancy, or even fully functional - it's just
a quick demo built to learn/practice gosu.
